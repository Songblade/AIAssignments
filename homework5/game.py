'''
Don't forget to delete this later.
So, I need to remember how Monte Carlo even works.
First, we select a move.
Then, we grow a tree from that node.
Then, we play a game from that node.
Then, we update our info.

Okay, so, let's start with selection. The slide suggests UCB. So, how do we do that again?
Except, apparently, we aren't actually using a tree at all. So...
Instead, whenever we are asked to input a move:
We randomly pick a move n times. Each time, we play a full random game from that point and record the results.
Then, we actually pick the move that has the best ratio.
