'''
Okay, so what am I doing wrong? Not only is my algorithm taking too long, it also isn't good enough. Taking too long by
itself isn't a problem, because I could probably get more efficiency by running the games in parallel. What is a problem
is that it's not good enough. That I have both problems suggests that they are connected. Or if not, I could make it
parallel after solving the first problem.

So, what am I doing wrong? I think I am solving the problem as well as he wants us to. But clearly, I'm not.

Okay, I just found a bug, but solving it seems to have made it worse. I think it's because I restricted it to legal
moves.
